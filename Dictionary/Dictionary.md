## Scope

The purpose of this document is to identify specific technical terms (definitions and abbreviations) used within the GSF specifications. Having a common collection of definitions and abbreviations related to the GSF documents will;
- Ensure that the terminology is used in a consistent manner across GSF documents
- Provide the reader a friendly tool explaining the technical terms that are used across multiple documents
- Help the editors in using the terminology in a consistent manner across GSF specifications.

The definitions and abbreviations as given in this document are
- created by the GSF working groups or sub-groups, when the need for precise definition is identified, or
- imported from existing documentation (e.g. ITU, 3GPP, 3GPP2)

## References
### Normative References

```
The policy for reference lists is:
1. GSF documents listed should have at least one approved version – draft-only docs should not be referenced.
Exception exists for documents that will be approved with or after the referenced doc is approved (may be part of same enabler package). In short – approved docs should not reference unapproved docs.
2. When a reference is made to an GSF specification, then Green Software Foundation™ with the TM symbol (™) should 
be used in the description.
3. The name + version (no date) for GSF specifications are generally sufficient – dates should be used only if there is a specific reason to limit the usage.
4. References to other affiliate docs should similarly provide sufficient information to uniquely determine the needed document and should provide the appropriate source information.
5. The URL for GSF material (new GSF and affiliate) should always be http://www.[add link].
    
Models to use:
	[REFLABEL]	<General Model> "Ref Title", Ref information (source, date, id), URL:http//<ref-source>/ 
	[GSFDOC]	<GSF Model> "GSF Document Title",{ Version x.y,}Green Software Foundation™, GSF <docname>{    <version>}, URL:[ADD HERE] 
If there are no entries in the table – enter ‘none’ to be clear.
